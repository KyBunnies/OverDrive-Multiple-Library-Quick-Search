			This extension adds a results box hovering over an OverDrive search or media item page with an
			ebook's availability for all of your saved libraries. It will let you know at a glance
			which have the book available to borrow, how many holds on how many copies at each library,
			and which might not even own the book. Click on the availability to go directly to a library,
			or click elsewhere on the box to shrink or expand it to read the page beneath it.</p>
		<p><img src="MLSresults.png" style="float:left; width:300px; margin-right:7px; vertical-align:bottom">
			This extension also adds a popup button to your chrome toolbar. Use it to quickly search OverDrive
			for an ebook or audiobook you wish to check out.</p>

			<li>Please make sure you are logged into your <a href="https://www.overdrive.com" target="_blank">OverDrive</a> account.</li>
			<li>You must have saved at least one library on the OverDrive website.</li>
			<li>To automatically find the names and websites of your libraries,
				press the "Setup" button.</li>
			<li>The extension will open and close a series of OverDrive tabs for a common book while it attempts
				to determine the correct web address for each of your saved libraries.</li>
		</ol>
		<button id='btnSetup'>Setup</button>
		<p>You may enter your library information manually by using the Add and Save buttons.
			If the web address does not point to an OverDrive.com site, its background will turn red.
			This means it will not show up in the Multiple Library Search results.</p>
		<p>In a few cases where a library still uses its own domain name for ebooks,
			the extension might not be able to determine the correct OverDrive.com address.
		 	To fix it, navigate to the library's OverDrive website in a new browser tab, then
			copy and paste the website address from the location bar of your browser into these options and save.</p>

			Your saved OverDrive libraries are listed in the table. The library abbreviation is what appears
			in the Multiple Library Search Results box. The OverDrive web address points to each
			library's individual ebook collection on OverDrive. The full name of each library (or the library district
			or library consortium) is in the last column.</p>
		<p>You may edit your library information manually. The Add button adds a blank row for a new library.
			A library may be deleted entirely by clearing all three of its columns, or you may clear just its web
			address to omit it from the Multiple Library Search Results box. No changes take effect until you
			save them. To cancel without saving, just close or reload this options popup.</p>
		<p>If the website address does not point to an OverDrive.com site, its background will turn red.
			This means it will not show up in the Multiple Library Search results. To rerun setup and try to automatically determine the library information again, you can use
			the Clear & Setup button to the right. You will delete any edits you have made to the list of libraries.</p>
