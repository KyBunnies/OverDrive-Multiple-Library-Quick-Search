# OverDrive-Multiple-Library-Quick-Search
A webform to search multiple OverDrive libraries

This page submits an OverDrive search and opens the results in a new tab (or a new window, depending on your browser settings). It is designed to be a timesaver for anyone with multiple library cards and multiple libraries to search.

If you are already logged in to OverDrive and have saved libraries, it will search by keyword in all of your saved libraries. You have the option of showing only eBooks or Audiobooks. To cut down on useless results, it will also try to only show books available in the region OverDrive automagically determines your ip to be in.

This page's correct operation depends on the stability of OverDrive's URL schema, changes to which are out of the control of the author. Consequently, this search page may break at any time.
