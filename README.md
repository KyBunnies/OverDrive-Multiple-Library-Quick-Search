# OverDrive-Multiple-Library-Quick-Search
Webform to search multiple OverDrive libraries

This tool submits an OverDrive search and opens the results in a new tab (or a new window, depending on your browser settings). It is designed to be a timesaver for anyone with multiple library cards and multiple libraries to search.

If you are already logged in to OverDrive and have saved libraries, it will search by keyword in all of your saved libraries. You have the option of showing only eBooks or Audiobooks. To cut down on useless results, it will also try to only show books available in the region OverDrive automagically determines your ip to be in.

This tool's correct operation depends on the stability of OverDrive's URL schema, changes to which are out of the control of the author. Consequently, this search page may break at any time.

## Browser extension details

The browser extension adds a results box hovering over an OverDrive search or media item page
containing a book's availability for all of your saved libraries. It will let you know at a glance
which have the book available to borrow, how many holds on how many copies at each library,
and which might not even own the book. Click on the availability to go directly to a library,
or click elsewhere on the box to shrink or expand it to read the page beneath it.

This extension also adds a popup button to your chrome toolbar. Use it to quickly search OverDrive
for an ebook or audiobook to check out.

## Roadmap

* Maintain simple webform as it is ideal on mobile browsers or for a panel in Vivaldi
* Develop browser extensions for Chrome, Opera, Firefox and possibly other browsers such as Safari
* Consider adding "available to borrow" information if the diversity of OverDrive implementations allows
