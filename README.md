# OverDrive-Multiple-Library-Quick-Search
Webform and browser extension to search multiple OverDrive libraries

This tool submits an OverDrive search and opens the results in a new tab (or a new window, depending on your browser settings). It is designed to be a timesaver for anyone with multiple library cards and multiple libraries to search.

If you are already logged in to OverDrive and have saved libraries, it will search by keyword in all of your saved libraries. You have the option of showing only eBooks or Audiobooks. To cut down on useless results, it will also try to only show books available in the region OverDrive automagically determines your ip to be in.

This tool's correct operation depends on the stability of OverDrive's URL schema, changes to which are out of the control of the author. Consequently, this search page may break at any time.

Tested: 20 March 2017 

## Roadmap

Maintain simple webform as it is ideal for a panel in Vivaldi or on mobile browsers
Develop browser extension for Chrome, Opera, Firefox and possibly other browsers sucha as $afari
Consider adding "availabile to borrrow" information if the diversity of OverDrive implementations allows
